----------
 OVERVIEW
----------
This project, BADVideo (Brighten And De-noise Video), is a project for my cs510
Computational Photography class at Portland State University.  BADVideo is a
small application that seeks to enhance underexposed, Low Dynamic Range (LDR)
videos by implementing the ideas found in two notable research papers:

"Video Enhancement Using Per-Pixel Virtual Exposures"
	by Eric P. Bennett and Leonard McMillan from The University of North
	Carolina at Chapel Hill
"Flash Photography Enhancement via Intrinsic Relighting"
	by Elmar Eisemann and Fredo Durand from MIT

	
------------
 ALGORITHMS
------------
//Filtering
	v = video
	v' = filtered video
	for each frame f in v:
		L = extract luminance channel of f //L = 0.2126*R + 0.7152*G + 0.0722*B
		L' = Gaussian(L)
		for each pixel p in L':
			lambda[p] = m(p,psi)*255 //estimate gain factor to feed into ASTA
		v'.f = ASTA(x,y,f, lambda, temporalBilatralSigma, spatialBilateralSigma)

 HOW TO USE IT
---------------
1. Click the icon for "Open." and select an .avi file.
2. Click the icon for "Enhance." and wait for the progress bar to fill.
3. Preview the output if you like by clicking the icon for "Preview."
4. Save the newly enahnced video by clicking the icon for "Save.".


----------------
 LANGUAGE/TOOLS 
----------------
BADVideo is written in C++/CLI with the OpenCV library using Visual Studio 2010.
Source code kept under revision control using Git.

    APPLICATION : BADVideo Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this BADVideo Application for you.  

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your BADVideo application.

BADVideo.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

BADVideo.vcxproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

BADVideo.cpp
    This is the main application source file.
    Contains the code to display the form.

Form1.h
    Contains the implementation of your form class and InitializeComponent() function.

AssemblyInfo.cpp
    Contains custom attributes for modifying assembly metadata.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named BADVideo.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.
