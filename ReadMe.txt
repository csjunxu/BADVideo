----------
 OVERVIEW
----------
This project, BADVideo (Brighten And De-noise Video), is a project for my cs510
Computational Photography class at Portland State University.  BADVideo is a
small application that seeks to enhance underexposed, Low Dynamic Range (LDR)
videos by implementing the ideas found in two notable research papers:

"Video Enhancement Using Per-Pixel Virtual Exposures"
	by Eric P. Bennett and Leonard McMillan from The University of North
	Carolina at Chapel Hill
"Flash Photography Enhancement via Intrinsic Relighting"
	by Elmar Eisemann and Fredo Durand from MIT

 ALGORITHM

---------------
 HOW TO USE IT
---------------
1. Click the icon for "Open." and select an .avi file.
2. Click the icon for "Enhance." and enter values for the parameters.
3. Preview the output if you like by clicking the icon for "Preview."
4. Save the newly enahnced video by clicking the icon for "Save.".


----------------
 LANGUAGE/TOOLS 
----------------
BADVideo is written in C++/CLI with the OpenCV library using Visual Studio 2010.
Source code kept under revision control using Git.

 NOTES
-------
- thought about temporal average/median sped up by only dropping off the oldest
  value and adding the newest value, but can't be done unless you go through the
  video cube per pixel per channel per frame (rather than per frame per pixel
  per channel), which would require an array of 921,600 temporal arrays.
- temporal ends (close to first frame, close to last frame) can be done in
  different ways (like image border when doing filters: use first/last frame for
  missing frames, extend missing frames to the other direction (currently using
  this strategy), or wrap around.
- pixel-channel with the max temporal range (temporal margin of 3)
	i: 74, y: 164, x: 443, c: 2
	[99, 119, 156, 159, 162, 162, 164]
- problems:
	- paper lacking in detailed explainations of formulas
	- normalizing (cvNormalize() always threw an SEHException, added extra
	  computation and memory), but do normalize in bilater filter so as not to
	  lose as much information
	- can't take advantage of temporal speed-up unless sacrifice memory
	- progress bar wouldn't work even with BackgroundWorker
	- can't compute std. dev. of temporal ranges on the fly
	- ghosting
	- execution time
- just bilateral filtering the images (and brightening) still had noise, just at
  a higher granularity.  Temporal median alone (and brightening) had distinct
  banding and slight ghosting.  Both temporal mediam and bilateral filter (of
  whole image) produced best results.

    APPLICATION : BADVideo Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this BADVideo Application for you.  

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your BADVideo application.

BADVideo.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

BADVideo.vcxproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

BADVideo.cpp
    This is the main application source file.
    Contains the code to display the form.

Form1.h
    Contains the implementation of your form class and InitializeComponent() function.

AssemblyInfo.cpp
    Contains custom attributes for modifying assembly metadata.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named BADVideo.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.
